Download
========

The way to download documents manually, one at a time, was to click on a particular document's name:

![Main](https://github.com/rishikapadia/99-Internship/blob/master/Planview-EPM%20Migration/planview-pics/main.jpg)

This would take you to a detail-view. From here, clicking on "Read" would automatically download the file to your computer.

My task was to figure out how to automate the process to download about 1400 documents, without having to click on each one manually. Fortunately, a quick look at the page source of the HTML and JavaScript code enabled me to do just that.

To automate downloading all files from Planview, I needed to find a list of all documents. If we look back to the main documents page:

![Main Page](https://github.com/rishikapadia/99-Internship/blob/master/Planview-EPM%20Migration/planview-pics/main.jpg)

I found this by clicking on "View all content" in the upper right-hand corner:

![view all content](https://github.com/rishikapadia/99-Internship/blob/master/Planview-EPM%20Migration/planview-pics/view_content.jpg)
