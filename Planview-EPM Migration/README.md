Planview-EPM Live Migration
===========================

Planview and EPM Live are online project management softwares. As second-in-charge of the entire migration process, I learned how to organize and manage complex projects, resource assignments, budget analyses, and the developmental aspects of the tools.

Even as an intern, I was given a considerable amount of freedom to complete the migration from Planview to EPM Live for the entire corporation. I was given the following high-level tasks to complete, using whatever tools I saw fit in order to do so:

1. Recreate the folder [hierarchy](https://github.com/rishikapadia/99-Internship/tree/master/Planview-EPM%20Migration/hierarchy) from Planview
2. [Download](https://github.com/rishikapadia/99-Internship/tree/master/Planview-EPM%20Migration/download) all documents from Planview
3. [Place](https://github.com/rishikapadia/99-Internship/tree/master/Planview-EPM%20Migration/place) all documents into their respective locations in the hierarchy
4. [Upload](https://github.com/rishikapadia/99-Internship/tree/master/Planview-EPM%20Migration/upload) data into EPM Live
