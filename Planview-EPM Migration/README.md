Planview-EPM Live Migration
===========================

Planview and EPM Live are online project management softwares. As second-in-charge of the entire migration process, I learned how to organize and manage complex projects, resource assignments, budget analyses, and the developmental aspects of the tools.

Even as an intern, I was given a considerable amount of freedom to complete the migrationfrom Planview to EPM Live. I was given the following high-level tasks to complete, using whatever I saw fit in order to do so:

1. Recreate the folder [hierarchy]() from Planview
2. [Download]() all documents from Planview
3. [Place]() all documents into their respective locations in the hierarchy
4. [Upload]() data into EPM Live

(In Progress)
