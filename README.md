99-Internship
=============

h3. Summer 2014

My internship experience at 99 Cents Only Stores, LLC was different from most other internships because I was exposed to a range of technologies. They wanted me to experience the development tools that are used in a corporate setting, as opposed to the open-source technologies one would see at a startup.

As expected of a retail chain, a typical developer at 99 works to make the company run more efficiently and smoothly. As such, they are often working on several small projects at once, and during my 10 weeks at the company I got a taste of life at a corporation headquarters.

Following are the major projects I have worked on as an IT intern at 99 Cents Only Stores:
