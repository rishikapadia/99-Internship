99-Internship
=============

###Summer 2014

My internship experience at 99 Cents Only Stores, LLC was different from most other internships because I was exposed to a range of technologies. They wanted me to experience the development tools that are used in a corporate setting, as opposed to the open-source technologies one would commonly see at a startup.

As expected of a retail chain, a typical developer at 99 works to make the company run more efficiently and smoothly. As such, they are often working on several small projects at once, and during my 10 weeks at the company I got a taste of life at a corporation headquarters.

Following are some of the major projects I have worked on as an IT intern at 99 Cents Only Stores:

Second-in-charge of the entire migration process.

###[HTML5 Store Scrap App](https://www.google.com)

Developed a prototype of an SSO Cycle Count to be used on handheld devices at the company's retail stores to keep track of item information. Uses ASP.NET and VB.NET as backend to the application, and runs on Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS). The app, once enhanced with live databases, will be used to replace some of the older technologies currently used at the company.
