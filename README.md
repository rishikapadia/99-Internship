99-Internship
=============

###Summer 2014
<br>
My internship experience at 99 Cents Only Stores, LLC was different from most other internships because I was exposed to a range of technologies. They wanted me to experience the development tools that are used in a corporate setting, as opposed to the open-source technologies one would commonly see at a startup.

As expected of a retail chain, a typical developer at 99 works to make the company run more efficiently and smoothly. As such, they are often working on several small projects at once, and during my 10 weeks at the company I got a taste of life at a corporation headquarters.

Following are some of the major projects I have worked on as an IT intern at 99 Cents Only Stores:

###[Planview-EPM Live Migration](https://www.google.com)

Planview and EPM Live are online project management softwares. As second-in-charge of the entire migration process, I learned how to organize and manage complex projects, resource assignments, budget analyses, and the developmental aspects of the tools.

###[HTML5 Store Scrap App](https://github.com/rishikapadia/99-Internship/tree/master/HTML5%20Store%20Scrap%20App)

Developed a prototype of an SSO Cycle Count to be used on handheld devices at the company's retail stores to keep track of item information. Uses ASP.NET and VB.NET as backend to the application, and runs on Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS). The app, once enhanced with live databases, will be used to replace some of the older technologies currently used at the company.

###[HighJump 11 WebWise History Report](https://github.com/rishikapadia/99-Internship/tree/master/HJ11%20Webwise%20History%20Report)

In HighJump 11, added a WebWise page to display transaction log history records.
It is currently a live WebWise report used at 99 Cents Only Stores.

###Automate Barnett benefit file from Lawson

Helped create a SQL package on a Lawson database to generate and ftp a file with employee information weekly. Created in Microsoft SQL Server 2012. (Code not in repo for company security reasons)

###Static Analysis Code Review

Using the SQL Enlight tool, helped improve readability and efficiency of SQL code. Determined/added relevant rulesets and updated processes in the tool.
